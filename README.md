TODO:

- compartmentalize into folders (processing, plots)
- preprocess raw data, fit LiFE, fit networks, evaluate stats (add additional workflow steps)
-- look at Brad's repo for an example
- save all output as .csv - EMD matrix and tract profiles (only profiles that exist)
- split big script into network building and tract profiles
-- compartmentalized dependencies, easier .csv export
- check other atlases
- build GLASSER w/ volume and surface

- check the ssh keys are ok
